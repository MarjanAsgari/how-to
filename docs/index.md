# How to use rasterio to read the header and  a subset of a remote COG 
[Code example](../how-to-guides/rasterio-example.py) that :
- Replicate the steps above to access the data href for a specific item/collection; 
- Read the header of a distant COG;
- Read a subset of a distant cog based on an area of interest;
- TODO : Save the subset into as a tif file
